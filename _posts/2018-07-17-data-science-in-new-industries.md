title: Bringing data science to new industries
---

Before starting the Master of Data Science (MDS) program at UBC, I had been working as a civil engineer for a consulting firm in Vancouver. I soon realized that despite producing vast amounts of data, the civil engineering and construction industries have had little influence from advancements in AI and machine learning. Having seen the capabilities of machine learning and AI technologies implemented in other industries, it became apparent that the civil engineering and construction industries could benefit greatly through the implementation of these technologies. 

The engineering and construction industries are not unique in this respect; many industries around the world are only now starting to take advantage of data science as the internet of things and mobile computing has allowed for data collection in traditionally non-data driven industries. The Masters of Data Science program at UBC has presented itself as a bridge, connecting students of diverse professional backgrounds with data science. Empowering professionals to harness the the value of their data will drive change and shape these industries in the future.

One of the best experiences I had with the MDS program was the year-end capstone project. During the last two months of the program, students work with an external capstone partner and a UBC mentor to address a question facing the capstone partnerâ€™s organization using data science. Just like the students, the capstone industry partners are diverse, ranging from agriculture to tourism. Coming from an engineering background, initially I was hesitant if I would find an industry partner that fit my experience. Despite having a good understanding of data science and analytics, it was important to me to be knowledgeable of the capstone partner's problem from their perspective to be able to formulate the appropriate solution. 

For the capstone project, my partner was BGC Engineering, a boutique geological engineering consultant with specialization in software development. Their goal was to develop an anomaly detection and flood forecasting system using real-time hydrometric data. Students in my group included a geoscientist with two masters degrees and a geography graduate. Our UBC mentor for the project is a doctorate in statistics who has publications related to anomaly detection. Needless to say, the breadth of knowledge in my team was vast, and is what ultimately lead us to fully understand the BGC Engineering's goal and how our solution can be implemented into their business.

While the capstone project showed me that there are companies in traditionally non-data driven industries utilizing big data, it signalled to me the start of acceptance and adoptance throughout these industries. I remain optimistic that the demand for data scientists will only continue to grow as more useful applications of data science are discovered.
