title: Teaching CNNs
subtitle: Breaking down convolutional neural networks

Main ideas:

- Teach 1D first
- Do not use the old figure type
- Use the circle/arrow figures
- Change multiplication ("0D convolution") to convolution

Smaller ideas:

- Differentiate between ordered and unordered dimensions (could show quiz question?!)
- Set padding so that the size stays the same
