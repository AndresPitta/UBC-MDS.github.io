title: About the Capstone Course
---

During the last two months of the MDS program (mid April to late June each year), our students work in teams with an external capstone partner and a teaching fellow mentor to address a question facing the capstone partner's organization using data science. This page provides an overview of the MDS capstone project. You may also be interested in the [partner information](/capstone/partner_info), the [timeline and procedures](/capstone/timeline). 

## The Capstone Projects

Successful MDS capstone projects...

- pose an interesting and open-ended question/problem that can be addressed using data science for which data is available or obtainable.
- pose a multi-faceted question/problem, containing enough dimensions to be addressed in a multitude of ways.
- are sufficiently deep, such that a useful data product can be made in two months that makes a solid advance on the problem.
- can be split up into milestones, such that concrete progress can be made in two months.
- draw on various tools and topics the students have learned in their [courses](https://ubc-mds.github.io/descriptions/) during the MDS program.

The work involved in each capstone project, completed by a group of ~4 MDS students, must include

- refining the project's over-arching question into one that can be directly addressed using data science;
- using data science to draw useful information and recommendations from data; and
- making the information and recommendations accessible to the capstone partner through various effective means of communication (such as documentation, visuals, presentations, and reports).

What a capstone project is _not_:

- Setting up and/or maintaining a database.
    - This type of project does not focus on drawing useful information from data.
- A pre-specified approach, such as applying a particular machine learning algorithm to a particular data set.
    - This type of project is too narrow, not open-ended, and has only one or a few solutions. We expect our students to creatively come up with their own data science approaches to address the capstone partner's over-arching question/problem (potentially with advice from the capstone partner on data science approaches).
- Data cleaning.
    - Although we expect some data wrangling to be involved in the project, we ask that you provide data that is mostly clean and "ready-to-go". If you need help with this, [ASDa](https://asda.stat.ubc.ca/) from the UBC Department of Statistics might be able to help for a fee.


## Student Expectations

We expect our student groups to

- communicate productively, identify sub-problems that could be worked on individually by team members, and integrate contributions of team members into a final product;
- work at least four full-time days per week on the project;
- document and present their work at UBC (using written, oral, and visual means) at various points throughout the course.
- optionally (but strongly recommended), present their final product and findings to the capstone partner's organization.
