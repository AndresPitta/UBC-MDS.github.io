title: Capstone Projects
subtitle: With the UBC MDS Program
---

During the last two months of the MDS program (mid April to late June each year), our students work in teams of ~4 students with an external capstone partner and a UBC mentor to address a question facing the capstone partner's organization using data science. The capstone program is free for partner organizations to participate in, but requires a point person who is willing to meet regularly with the students and offer guidance.

For more information on becoming a partner, see our [partner information page](/capstone/partner_info). For guidelines on submitting a proposal, see our [proposal page](/capstone/proposal). For various important dates and deadlines, see our [timeline and procedures](/capstone/timeline) page.
