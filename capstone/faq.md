Here are answers to some frequently asked questions regarding our capstone course. Don't see the answer to your question here, or elsewhere on the capstone course website? Please contact us at `sthg_capstone@sthg.ubc.ca` -- we'll be happy to talk with you!

#### 1. Is there a fee to participate?

No, there is no fee involved anywhere in the process.

#### 2. Do you allow the students work at the capstone partner's location?

Yes, we do allow this, but it is not required. We do request that the students work on UBC campus at least once per week.

#### 3. Is there flexibility in the project after it is proposed?

Within reason. Please contact us at `sthg_capstone@sthg.ubc.ca` if you have concerns.

#### 4. Can I submit more than one project proposal?

Yes, but it's possible that we will give priority to one of your projects to give other candidate partners a chance at participating. Also:

- the projects should be sufficiently different so that there is little overlap.
- you should be willing to work with a group of students for each project.

#### 5. Will you sign a non-disclosure agreement?

Yes, we offer a standard UBC NDA that we can share with you if you are interested. Contact us at `sthg_capstone@sthg.ubc.ca`.

#### 6. Can the proposed project be "solved"?

We ask that our students try new approaches to a problem, and not replicate your work. However, we expect our capstone projects to be open-ended, having various approaches for addressing a problem, as opposed to having a single solution. We would encourage our students to either build on your work, or address the problem from a different angle.

#### 7. Do I need to know data science to participate? Do I need to be able to suggest approaches for the students to take in addressing the problem I'm proposing?

No, this is not a requirement. In fact, a major part of our capstone course is for students to decide on approaches for addressing the problem using data science. We do not encourage our students to simply apply some requested data science techniques to the problem. However, please _do_ share your ideas if you have them!

#### 8. I participated as a capstone partner in a previous year. Can I participate again?

Absolutely! We will be happy to work with you. Please submit a proposal.
