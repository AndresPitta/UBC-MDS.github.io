Here are answers to some frequently asked questions regarding our capstone course. Don't see the answer to your question here, or elsewhere on the capstone course website? Please contact us at `sthg_capstone@sthg.ubc.ca` -- we'll be happy to talk with you!

#### 1. Is there a fee to participate as a partner?

No, there is no fee involved anywhere in the process.

#### 2. Where do the students work on the capstone projects?

We have workspaces available for the students on the UBC Vancouver campus, and expect students to work on campus at least once per week. Otherwise, we are flexible as to the work location. 

#### 3. Is there flexibility in the project after it is proposed?

Within reason. Please contact us at `sthg_capstone@sthg.ubc.ca` if you have concerns.

#### 4. Can an organization submit more than one project proposal?

Yes, but it's possible that we will give priority to only one of the projects, so as to give other candidate partners a chance at participating. Also, the projects should be sufficiently different so that there is little overlap, and partners should be willing to put in time to work with each student group.

#### 5. Will MDS sign a non-disclosure agreement?

Yes, we offer a standard UBC NDA that we can share with interested organizations. Contact us at `sthg_capstone@sthg.ubc.ca`.

#### 6. Can the proposed project be "solved"?

We ask that our students try new approaches to a problem, and not replicate our partners' work. However, we expect our capstone projects to be open-ended, having various approaches for addressing a problem, as opposed to having a single solution. We would encourage our students to either build on our partners' work, or address the problem from a different angle.

#### 7. Do partners need to know data science to participate? Do partners need to be able to suggest approaches for the students to take in addressing the proposed problem?

No, this is not a requirement. In fact, a major part of our capstone course is for students to decide on approaches themselves for addressing the problem using data science. We do not encourage our students to simply apply some requested data science techniques to the problem. However, we _do_ encourage our partners to share their ideas if they have them!

#### 8. I participated as a capstone partner in a previous year. Can I participate again?

Absolutely! We will be happy to work with you. Please submit a proposal.
