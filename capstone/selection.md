## Procedure

Here are the steps involved in launching a capstone project.

#### Submit a project proposal.

Please submit a one-page [proposal](./proposal.md) to `sthg_capstone@sthg.ubc.ca`.

Members of the MDS leadership team will review your proposal, and reply with our decision as soon as possible. The possible decisions are:

- Accept outright;
- Accept, conditional on changes;
- Reject.

We will always provide a reason for our decision. If your proposal is rejected, please do try again with another proposal. We will be happy to receive it.

> REMARK: I think it's more fair for our partners if we end the application period at a specified date, as opposed to whenever we have "enough" applications. Also, it seems less desirable to only accept the first $n$ organizations that apply. Hence the need for part 2 below.

#### Student Selection

Once your application is accepted, it is posted on a "project board" viewable by the students. The students will then rate their interest in your proposal by a certain date, according to the following scale:

- 1: reject
- 2: apply (default)
- 3: apply with interest
- 4: apply with enthusiasm

> REMARK: Note that we can have students give a "2" by default, and only change the ones they're interested/disinterested in.

Those candidates that receive the highest ratings will be accepted as capstone projects.

#### Presentation

We require that the capstone partners give a 30-minute presentation (which includes a question period) to the students and MDS leadership over lunch at the UBC Vancouver campus. 

#### Group Assignments

After all the presentations have been given, the students will give a final rating to the capstone partners, which will inform the group assignments.

In the unlikely scenario that we are unable to form a group with sufficient interest in the project, we will not assign any group to that project.

#### Data and NDA

Next, if you require a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to be signed, we expect all parties to sign on well before the capstone course begins. Also, we expect that you make the data available well before the capstone course begins.

#### Kickoff meeting

The students will arrange a date and time with their capstone partner and teaching fellow mentor to have an initial meeting to discuss the project.
