Here are the steps involved in launching a capstone project.

#### Partners submit a project proposal

Please submit a one-page [proposal](./proposal.md) to `sthg_capstone@sthg.ubc.ca`.

Members of the MDS leadership team will review your proposal, and reply with our decision as soon as possible. The possible decisions are:

- Accept outright;
- Accept, conditional on changes;
- Reject.

We will always provide a reason for our decision. If your proposal is rejected, please do try again with another proposal. We will be happy to receive it.

> REMARK: I think it's more fair for our partners if we end the application period at a specified date, as opposed to whenever we have "enough" applications. Also, it seems less desirable to only accept the first $n$ organizations that apply. Hence the need for part 2 below.

#### Selection of proposals

Once your application is accepted, it is posted on a "project board" viewable by the students. The students will then rate their interest in your proposal by a certain date, according to the following scale:

- 1: reject
- 2: apply (default)
- 3: apply with interest
- 4: apply with enthusiasm

> REMARK: Note that we can have students give a "2" by default, and only change the ones they're interested/disinterested in.

Those candidates that receive the highest ratings will be accepted as capstone projects.

#### Partners provide data

Next, we'll need you to provide us with:

- the data, or at least a snippet of it; and
- if you require it, concensus on any paperwork such as a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).


#### Presentation period

We require that the capstone partners give a 30-minute presentation (which includes a question period) to the students and MDS leadership over lunch at the UBC Vancouver campus. 


#### Students rate the projects

After all the presentations have been given, the students will give a final rating to the capstone partners, which will inform the group assignments.

In the unlikely scenario that we are unable to form a group with sufficient interest in the project, we will not assign any group to that project.

#### Students are assigned to projects

#### Kickoff meetings

The students will arrange a date and time with their capstone partner and teaching fellow mentor to have an initial meeting to discuss the project.
