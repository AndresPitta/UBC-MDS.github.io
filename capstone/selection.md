## Procedure

Here are the steps involved in launching a capstone project. Please feel free to correspond with us at `sthg_capstone@sthg.ubc.ca` throughout the process.

#### Organizations submit proposals

Members of an organization interested in participating as a capstone partner should submit a one-page project [proposal](./proposal.md) to `sthg_capstone@sthg.ubc.ca`.

Members of the MDS leadership team will review the proposal, and work with the potential partner to establish a finalized proposal. Potential partners should feel free to ask us for our opinion on any aspect of this step ahead of time, such as whether the main idea of the proposal is appropriate.

#### Students rate proposals

A list of finalized proposals, along with one-sentence summaries, will be posted on a "project board" viewable by the students. The students will then rate their interest in the proposals, according to the following scale:

- 1: reject
- 2: apply (default)
- 3: apply with interest
- 4: apply with enthusiasm

#### Selection of proposals

The MDS leadership team will select proposals based primarily on student interest, and will invite the successful organizations to be a capstone partner. 

#### Partners accept invitations

The successful capstone partners accept the offer, and correspond with MDS administration to schedule a presentation to give at UBC. 

#### Partners provide data

Before the presentations, the partners must provide MDS with:

- the data (at least some form of it); and
- if required, concensus on any paperwork such as a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).

Partners should feel free to ask us for our standard agreement at any point in the selection procedure.

#### Partner presentations

We require that the capstone partners give a 30-minute presentation (allowing for 10-15 minutes of questions) to the students and MDS leadership over lunch at the UBC Vancouver campus.

#### Students rate the projects

After the presentations, the students assign a final rating to the projects. 

#### Students are assigned to projects

Based on student interest, the MDS leadership team assigns student groups to the projects. In the unlikely scenario that there is insufficient interest in a project, no student group will be assigned to that project. 

#### Kickoff meetings

The students will arrange a date and time with their capstone partner and teaching fellow mentor to have an initial meeting to discuss the project.
