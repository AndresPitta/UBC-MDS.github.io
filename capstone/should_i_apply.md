title: Should I Apply to be a Capstone Partner?

---

Interested in being a capstone partner? Here is what is expected of you, along with the benefits you receive.

## What is expected of me?

- You should be able to provide our students with ample data that is relevant to a question/problem faced by your organization. This need not belong to the capstone partner's organization -- for example, it could come freely online.
    - Datasets must be sufficiently clean, and an appropriate and size that the students will be able to load into R and/or Python in a reasonable amount of time and effort.

- The partner must be available to meet with MDS students working on the capstone project (in person ideally) every 1-2 weeks during the two months students are working on the capstone project.

- The partner is expected to be present (in person or remotely) for the students' final presentation of the capstone project (whether at UBC or at your organization).

- The partner must come to an agreement about data and product sharing, licensing and intellectual product rights. The MDS program will support agreements that benefit both the students and the partners. Please note that it will be key for the students to share some aspect of the project in their portfolios/curriculum vitae during their job search following graduation from the MDS program.

- Preference will be given to organizations located in Canada, and especially in the Vancouver area.

## What's in it for me?

- An opportunity to get to know and work with ~4 data scientists-in-training working on your dataset/project for ~2 months, at no cost, who could be potential future employees. These students will be well versed in modern data science tools and techniques, including statistical analysis and visualizations using R and Python.

- A well-developed product of interest/relevance to your work (*e.g.,* Shiny app, analytic report, scripts/software). This product is expected to be of high quality, with excellent code documentation and testing.

- An opportunity to develop a relationship with the UBC MDS program. These relationships have the possibility of kickstarting research collaborations between the partners and UBC.
