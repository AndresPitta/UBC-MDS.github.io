#### Proposal revision process

Members of an organization interested in participating as a capstone partner should submit a project [proposal](https://ubc-mds.github.io/capstone/partner_info/#proposals).

Members of the MDS leadership team will review the proposal, and work with the potential partner to establish a finalized proposal. Potential partners should feel free to ask us for our opinion on any aspect of this step ahead of time, such as whether the main idea of the proposal is appropriate.

We recommend your first submission of the proposal to be well before the December 31st deadline, so that we can offer suggestions in case it needs revision.

#### Selection of proposals

The MDS leadership team will select proposals based primarily on student interest, and will invite the successful organizations to be a capstone partner.

#### Partners accept invitations

The successful capstone partners accept the offers, and confirm their attendance at the capstone fair.

#### Capstone fair

Capstone partners must attend the Capstone Fair, to be held in February 2019 (date TBD), to meet with the students and answer any questions they may have. Detailed information will be emailed to each capstone partner.


#### Students rate the projects

After the capstone fair, the students assign a final rating to the projects.


#### Partners provide data

Before a project is accepted, the partner must provide MDS with a demonstration or written (email) declaration that the data has already been collected and prepared, and exists in its entirety (in the form specified in the proposal), and is ready to be shared with the students.

Partners should feel free to ask us for our standard agreement at any point in the selection procedure.

#### Students are assigned to projects

Based on student interest, the MDS leadership team assigns student groups to the projects. In the unlikely scenario that there is insufficient interest in a project, no student group will be assigned to that project.

#### Kickoff meetings

The students will arrange a date and time with their capstone partner and teaching fellow mentor to have an initial meeting to discuss the project.

#### Project

The project itself. At the end, partners can expect the students to present at the partner organizations. Partners will also be invited to an end-of-program celebration at UBC.
