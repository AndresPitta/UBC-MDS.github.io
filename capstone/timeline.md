## Procedure

Here are the steps involved in launching a capstone project. Please feel free to correspond with us at `sthg_capstone@sthg.ubc.ca` throughout the process.

#### Organizations submit proposals

Members of an organization interested in participating as a capstone partner should submit a one-page project [proposal](./proposal.md) to `capstone-mds@science.ubc.ca`.

Members of the MDS leadership team will review the proposal, and work with the potential partner to establish a finalized proposal. Potential partners should feel free to ask us for our opinion on any aspect of this step ahead of time, such as whether the main idea of the proposal is appropriate.

#### Students rate proposals

A list of finalized proposals, along with one-sentence summaries, will be posted on a "project board" viewable by the students. The students will then rate their interest in the proposals, according to the following scale:

- 1: reject
- 2: accept (default)
- 3: accept with interest
- 4: accept with extra interest

#### Selection of proposals

The MDS leadership team will select proposals based primarily on student interest, and will invite the successful organizations to be a capstone partner.

#### Partners accept invitations

The successful capstone partners accept the offers, and correspond with MDS administration to schedule a presentation to give at UBC.

#### Partners provide data

Before the presentations are given, the partners must provide MDS with:

- the data (at least some form of it); and
- if required, consensus on any paperwork such as a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).

Partners should feel free to ask us for our standard agreement at any point in the selection procedure.

#### Partner presentations

We require that the capstone partners give a 30-minute presentation (allowing for 10-15 minutes of questions) to the students and MDS leadership over lunch at the UBC Vancouver campus.

#### Students rate the projects

After the presentations, the students assign a final rating to the projects.

#### Students are assigned to projects

Based on student interest, the MDS leadership team assigns student groups to the projects. In the unlikely scenario that there is insufficient interest in a project, no student group will be assigned to that project.

#### Kickoff meetings

The students will arrange a date and time with their capstone partner and teaching fellow mentor to have an initial meeting to discuss the project.

#### Student proposal stage

Students propose the data product and approach.

  1. The student team works with each other, colleagues, and teaching fellows to develop an approach in a 2-day hackathon.
  2. Students present the proposal at UBC, to solicit ideas and feedback.
  3. Students write the proposal. This will be passed to the capstone partner to check that the proposed product is indeed in line with the capstone partner's needs.

#### Project development stage

Students develop the data product. This involves:

    - Regular meetings with the teaching fellow mentor.
    - Regular meetings with the capstone partner.
    - Recording your progress and explorations in a data science notebook.

#### Project polishing stage

Students polish the data product for delivery to the capstone partner:

    1. Deliver the data product after incorporating feedback from teaching fellows and colleagues, along with a final report.
    2. Briefly present product(s) in an end-of-program celebration (not graded).
    3. At the end, students also reflect on the project in a short individual report.

#### Final presentations

Students present the final data product and approach to the class.
