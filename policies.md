Below is a draft of the policies and regulations to be added to the Github.io website. Please feel free to edit and suggest items that may be missing.

Program Policies and Regulations

The Master of Data Science Policies and Regulations are part of the campus-wide UBC Policies and Regulations document: http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/?tree=3,0,0,0. Below is a summary of those Policies and Regulations that students frequently ask about and that are specific to the Master of Data Science program.

Attendance

Regular attendance is expected of students in all their classes (including lectures, laboratories, tutorials, seminars, etc.). Students who are unavoidably absent because of illness or other reasons should inform both the instructor(s) of the course(s) and a Teaching Fellow as soon as possible, preferably, prior to the start of the class/lab.

Students who miss a quiz or assignment, need to provide a doctor's note and schedule a make-up quiz with a Teaching Fellow as soon as possible. Failing to present a doctor's note may result in a failing grade.

Students who miss more than 3 days of classes/labs in a row need to provide documentation in the form of a doctor's note or written request for leave to the MDS Leadership Team. Failing to present a doctor's note or written request may result in a failing grade. The Leadership Team will contact the student with an action plan to make up any missed quizzes or assignments.

Academic Standing: Passing/Failing

UBC courses are graded out of 100%. To pass an MDS course a student must score 60% or above. To graduate from MDS, a student must pass all courses, with no more than 3 courses in the 60%-67% range. With a few exceptions (which will be communicated to students at the start of a course), each course grade is calculated using the lab and quiz grades, weighted 60% and 40% respectively. However, if a student fails the quiz component of a course (below 60%) then their final course grade will be the lower of their calculated course grade and 67%. This means that to graduate a student cannot fail the quiz component of more than 3 courses.

Quizzes

Unless otherwise specified, quizzes will be closed-book. This means that during the quiz students are expected to:

be physically present in the quiz room (cannot take a quiz from a remote location)
not communicate with other students or anyone else
not use the internet to solve questions on the quiz
not bring any materials into the quiz that would be of assistance in completing the quiz (aside from a laptop)
not leave the quiz room early with your laptop, and not come back into the quiz room after leaving (other than for purposes such as using the washroom)
Failing to observe the above expectations may result in a zero grade in the quiz in question.

Plagiarism

Plagiarism, which is intellectual theft, occurs where an individual submits or presents the oral or written work of another person as his or her own and can include:

multiple students submitting the same response
copying from sources without citing them
copying verbatim (word-for-word) from source and citing, but failing to make it explicit that this is a quotation (quotations should be used only rarely, if at all)
Plagiarism will not be tolerated in the MDS program and may result in a zero grade in the assignment or quiz where plagiarism is observed. Students are responsible for ensuring that any work submitted does not constitute plagiarism. Students who are in any doubt as to what constitutes plagiarism should consult their Instructor or Teaching Fellow before handing in any assignments.

Code Plagiarism

Students must correctly cite any code that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of code plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:
• the reproduction (copying and pasting) of code with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)
• the translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another
• the generation of code by automatic code-generations software
An “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.

Leaves of Absence (medical or personal)

Students in good academic standing may request long-term academic leave from the program for medical or personal reasons and return, within a year, to complete the MDS program. These requests must be discussed and submitted in writing to the MDS Leadership Team well in advance. Leaves can only start at the beginning of a term, which for MDS, is January 1st. It is also possible that the MDS course offerings and orders change from year-to-year. Hence, students who are on leave from the program may have to take their outstanding courses in in a different order than expected. Please be aware that fees and other costs (loss of student loans and bursaries) may apply depending on individual situations.

Program Withdrawal

Students may withdraw from the MDS program for medical or personal reasons. Depending on the timing of the withdrawal, full or partial tuition fee refunds may or may not be given. A request to withdraw from the program must be submitted in writing to the MDS Leadership Team.

The MDS Leadership Team may request a student to withdraw from the program. This is only done after extensive discussions between the instructional team, the leadership team and the affected student. Reasons for this may be related to the health and well-being of the student in question or his/her peers, not meeting program requirements, unsatisfactory conduct or other significant reasons.

Full-Time Commitment

The MDS program is approved by the UBC Senate as a full-time program. Hence, students must take the program on a full-time basis as part of their cohort and cannot complete the program on a part-time basis.
