title: Grades in MDS

#### Individual grades: raw and scaled

All grades in the MDS program are on a 3-point scale based on our [rubrics](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/tree/master/rubric).
These raw scores between 0 and 3 are then mapping to percentages using the following scheme:

| Raw score | Scaled Score |
|-----------|---------|
| 0 | 0% |
| 1 | 50% |
| 2 | 80% |
| 3 | 95% |

To get above 95% in a course you need to earn bonus points by either doing something amazing on normal questions or by doing
the questions marked "optional".
We plan/hope to use this mapping for all MDS courses but it is of course possible that we will need to
revisit it later in case things are not working out sanely.

#### Final course grades

For most MDS courses, the grade will be calculated as 60% lab and 40% quiz. However, some exceptions apply when quiz scores are low.
See the [policies document](/policies/) under "Academic Standing" for more information.

#### Letter grades
For Master's students, percentage grades are converted to letter grades as follows:

| Percentage (%) |	Letter Grade|
|---------------|---------------|
| 90-100 | 	A+ |
| 85-89 | 	A |
| 80-84 |	A- |
| 76-79 | 	B+ |
| 72-75 |	B |
| 68-71 |	B- |
| 64-67 |	C+ |
| 60-63 |	C |
| 0-59 	| F (Fail)  |

#### Re-grading

If you have concerns about the way your work was graded, please contact the TA who graded it _within one week of having the grade returned to you_. After this one-week window, we may deny your request for re-evaluation. Also, please keep in mind that your grade may go up or down as a result of re-grading.
