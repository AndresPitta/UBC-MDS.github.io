title: Contributing to the MDS blog

To contribute to the [MDS blog](https://ubc-mds.github.io/), follow these steps to work with the blog's Editor, which is currently [Mike Gelbart](https://github.com/mgelbart):

1. Contact the Editor and agree on the basic outline of the post. 
2. Fork [the repo that houses this site](https://github.com/ubc-mds/ubc-mds.github.io) and give the Editor write access to the fork.
3. Create a new file in the `_posts` directory, write a draft, and push it to your fork.
4. Iterate back and forth with the Editor until the post is ready.
5. Submit a pull request from your fork to the blog repo (but be careful not to send it to the [parent of the blog repo](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll), which can happen by accident).
6. The Editor will merge the PR and the post will automatically appear on the MDS blog.
