## Tips for applying to the MDS program

#### 1. Understand the program

Read about the program thoroughly, to fully understand what kind of students the program is looking for. 
MDS is a professional Masterâ€™s program, not a research program. We expect most of our graduates to enter the workforce after the program.
While we also anticipate a few students may pursue further graduate studies in a domain area of interest, 
our program is not geared towards preparing students for further graduate studies in statistics or computer science. 
If your ultimate goal is to pursue a PhD in statistics or computer science, MDS is likely not the best fit for you.

#### 2. Letter of Intent 

A strong Letter of intent possesses the following qualities:

- it is specific to UBC and to the MDS program; it demonstrates that the applicant understands the nature and goals of the MDS program.
- the student explains how the program fits into the student's career trajectory.
- the student explains what value the UBC MDS program can offer to the student, and maybe what value the student can offer to the program.
- the letter is well-written and does not contain typos or grammatical errors.
- the letter uses reasonable margins and font sizes, and adheres to the maximum length guidelines.

#### 3. References

Letters of reference should help the admissions committee to get a complete understanding of a candidate. 
We don't recommend reference letters from people who barely know you:
no matter how famous they are, if your referee doesn't know you then the letter doesn't help your cause.
This issue arises particular often with instructors who taught a course the student was in.
If the letter is a simple report of your grade in the course (even if it is a great grade!), 
it does not add any new information not already contained within your transcripts.

Before asking for a reference letter, speak with the potential referee: 
do they have something particular and special to say about you? Do they have the time and willingness to write the letter, and in a timely manner?
Do they seem enthusiastic to provide a reference letter for you?

#### 4. If something is unclear, explain it

Your application is your opportunity to communicate all relevant information to the admissions committee. 
Thus, it's in your best interest to provide the committee with sufficient information to make a decision.
For example, perhaps you took a gap year, or two, which creates a gap of "unexplained time" in your resume. Even if your
activities during that time don't seem to contribute to your credentials for the MDS program, you should explain what you were doing.
This eliminates the case for any lingering, unanswered questions the committee might have about your file. 
As another example, if you have one (or a few) very bad grades but there is a particular reason for your performance, explain it. 
The explanation doesn't erase the grade but it provides context and makes a better impression than an unexplained bad grade.
