## MDS Block representatives

Every block, a student volunteers to represent their peers, acting as a liaison between students and MDS leadership (we/our/ours). This allows us to see how the block is going, allowing us to make changes if need be. 

Here are some guidelines for the "block rep".

#### 1. Introduce yourself to your peers as the new block rep

We recommend doing this via Slack. If there isn't a "students only" channel, please do make one. You can try creating a private channel and then tagging `@students` in there. This will hopefully prompt you to invite all students into the channel.

#### 2. Collect feedback throughout the block

The main responsibility is to collect feedback from your classmates. How you do this is up to you. Some block reps use online surveys, or even invite students to meet them in person during a dedicated time.

Each block, we will be dedicating a time during lecture for students to discuss the block as a class. This is a great avenue for the block rep to record some key insights.

The block rep often chooses to create a short informal report (usually in Markdown), which we archive on our end.

#### 3. Attend our team meeting

We'll ask you to attend our team meeting, usually about 2/3 or 3/4 through the block. Typically the block rep part of the meeting takes about 20 minutes, right at the start, but it’s flexible. We’ll continue the meeting without the block rep after you're done, where we'll continue to reflect on / discuss what we heard.

#### 4. Communicate back to the cohort

After the team meeting, we might ask the block rep to contact students. You can probably do this via Slack.  

## A note on the role of the block rep feedback

In the past, I think there was some confusion amongst students about the roles of the block rep survey vs. the official UBC course evaluations at the end of the block. We see their roles as roughly formative vs. summative assessment, respectively. That is, your role as block rep is to give us information to help us improve, rather than give us an A+ or a C-. Your results will be heard/read by the core MDS team, and the information will be used to improve the program. Since we get this feedback _during_ the block, we can sometimes make immediate changes within a given course. The formal UBC course evaluations, on the other hand, come after the course ends. They are seen by a different group of people, including the department heads and the Dean. As instructors, these will become part of our "file" and may influence things like tenure/promotion, or get someone into trouble if the evaluations are very poor. While we certainly do read all the comments on the official evaluations (and therefore they are also useful in improving our teaching), you can also think of them as a more formal summative evaluation of our teaching. Whether or not these evaluations do a good job of this is a topic of heated debate, though; see e.g., [this article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-014-9313-4).
