title: Relevant MOOCs
subtitle: Suggested as extra preparation for entering UBC MDS students
---

The following is a list of online courses that might be useful preparation for the UBC MDS program. Completion of these courses
does not replace the [official program prerequisites](http://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/admissions). Rather, this page is
mainly intended for entering students who may wish to reinforce their preparation before the program starts.

Disclaimer: We have not vetted these courses ourselves but rather selected them based on their descriptions seeming appropriate. 
If you have feedback about them, please [let us know](http://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/contact-us).
